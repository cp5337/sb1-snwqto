# Security and Compliance

Ensuring the security of CTAS and maintaining compliance with relevant standards is crucial. This document outlines the security measures implemented in CTAS and provides guidance on compliance.

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - JWT-based authentication for API access

2. **Data Encryption**
   - All data encrypted at rest using AES-256
   - TLS 1.3 for all network communications

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging of all system actions
   - Tamper-evident log storage

4. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Regular automated vulnerability scans
   - Timely patching of identified vulnerabilities

5. **Secure Development Practices**
   - Code review process
   - Regular security training for developers
   - Static and dynamic code analysis

## Compliance

CTAS is designed to help organizations meet various compliance requirements:

1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Data minimization principles
   - Right to erasure (right to be forgotten) support
   - Data portability features

2. **HIPAA Compliance**
   - Secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI)
   - Access controls and audit trails

3. **PCI DSS Compliance**
   - Secure handling of payment card information
   - Network segmentation capabilities

4. **ISO 27001**
   - Alignment with information security management best practices

5. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
   - Mapping of CTAS features to NIST CSF core functions

## Compliance Reporting

CTAS includes built-in reporting tools to assist with compliance audits:

- Customizable compliance reports
- Automated data collection for common compliance requirements
- Export capabilities for audit evidence

## Security Best Practices

To maintain the security of your CTAS deployment:

1. Regularly update CTAS and all dependencies
2. Implement strong password policies
3. Use MFA for all user accounts
4. Regularly review and audit user access
5. Monitor system logs for suspicious activities
6. Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
