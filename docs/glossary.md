# CTAS Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used in CTAS and its documentation.

## A

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols and tools for building software applications.

**APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)**: A stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.

## C

**CTAS (Complex Threat Analysis System)**: A comprehensive platform for offensive cyber operations, strategic intelligence gathering, and response planning.

## D

**Detect**: The second phase of the HD4 framework, focused on identifying potential threats and anomalies.

**Disable**: The third phase of the HD4 framework, aimed at neutralizing identified threats.

**Disrupt**: The fourth phase of the HD4 framework, focused on interfering with adversary operations.

**Dominate**: The final phase of the HD4 framework, aimed at achieving long-term control over adversary systems or networks.

## G

**Graph Database**: A database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.

## H

**HD4 Framework**: The core operational methodology in CTAS, standing for Hunt, Detect, Disable, Disrupt, and Dominate.

**Hunt**: The first phase of the HD4 framework, focused on proactive threat searching and intelligence gathering.

## M

**Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

**MurmurHash**: A non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup used in CTAS for efficient data processing.

## N

**Neo4j**: An open-source, NoSQL, native graph database tha
