## High Priority

1. [CTAS-1] Implement proper error handling for database initialization and API connections
2. [CTAS-2] Add user authentication and authorization
3. [CTAS-5] Replace mock database with a real database connection (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
4. [CTAS-11] Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls
5. [CTAS-17] Implement user roles and permissions for admin dashboard access

## Medium Priority

6. [CTAS-3] Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
7. [CTAS-6] Implement proper error handling for database operations
8. [CTAS-7] Add data validation and sanitization
9. [CTAS-12] Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse
10. [CTAS-13] Implement caching for API responses to reduce unnecessary calls
11. [CTAS-14] Implement proper authentication for API calls

13. [CTAS-18] Add more advanced configuration options for the admin dashboard
14. [CTAS-19] Implement real-time system monitoring in the admin dashboard

## Low Priority

15. [CTAS-4] Implement proper error handling and user notification in the main App component
16. [CTAS-8] Implement pagination for large datasets in the database utility
17. [CTAS-9] Add search and filtering capabilities to the database utility
18. [CTAS-10] Implement data caching for improved performance in the database utility
19. [CTAS-16] Implement a queue system for handling multiple API requests

## Ongoing

20. Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities
21. Improve test coverage across the application
22. Enhance documentation for better maintainability and onboarding

This backlog is subject to change based on project priorities and new requirements. Items will be moved to the active sprint as they are prioritized for development.
