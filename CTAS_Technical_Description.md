- Threat Analysis Service: Core service for threat detection and analysis.
- Task Management Service: Manages and tracks operational tasks.
- HD⁴ Strategy Service: Implements the Hunt, Detect, Disrupt, Disable, and Dominate framework.

### 2.3 Data Storage
- MongoDB: Primary database for storing operational data and user information.
- Neo4j: Graph database for storing and analyzing complex threat relationships.

### 2.4 Message Broker
- Apache Kafka: Facilitates real-time data streaming between services.

### 2.5 External Integrations

- Graph Analysis Engine: Specialized engine for analyzing graph-based threat data.

## 3. Key Capabilities

### 3.1 HD⁴ Framework
The core operational framework built around Hunt, Detect, Disrupt, Disable, and Dominate (HD⁴):
- Hunt: Identifies potential targets and adversary networks using reconnaissance and analysis.
- Detect: Uses Elasticsearch and NLP to uncover patterns and anomalies indicating adversary activities.
- Disrupt: Takes offensive actions to disrupt adversary networks and C2 channels.
- Disable: Executes targeted actions to permanently disable adversary infrastructure.
- Dominate: Leverages deception tactics and emulation to maintain control over adversary actions.

### 3.2 Threat Actor Emulation and Simulation
- Supports realistic emulation of threat actors to simulate potential attack paths and tactics.
- Uses historical data and behavioral models to mimic APTs or terrorist groups across cyber and physical domains.

### 3.3 Sector-Specific Adaptation
- Integrates with sector-specific plans (e.g., critical infrastructure sectors).
- NLP-driven metadata extraction allows CTAS to adapt operations based on sector priorities and risk assessments.

### 3.4 Integration with External Tools
- Interfaces with external reconnaissance tools (e.g., Shodan, Censys) and Kali Linux tools.
- APIs to connect with external databases, including national cybersecurity advisories and ISAC threat feeds.

### 3.5 Operational Resilience and Deployment Options
- Supports on-premises deployment within WSL environments or Kali Linux instances.
- Cloud deployments using Kubernetes for scalability and distributed team collaboration.

## 4. Security and Compliance Features

### 4.1 Data Integrity and Encryption
- Synaptic Contextual Hashing (SCH) for maintaining data integrity and tracking changes.
- TLS encryption for secure communication between system components.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for restricted access to sensitive data and operations.

### 4.2 Audit Trail and Reporting
- Comprehensive audit trail of all actions, queries, and changes within the system.
- Detailed reports generation for post-mission analysis, legal reviews, and strategic assessments.
